# QHS_LIGO_MatchedFiltering
This project builds on the Quantum Harmonic Shift (QHS) theory, which models gravity as an emergent harmonic field. The matched filtering analysis uses LIGO-compatible waveform models to detect structural similarity between solitonic vortex energy and gravitational chirps.
